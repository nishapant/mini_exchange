## This file is a template, and might need editing before it works on your project.
## To contribute improvements to CI/CD templates, please follow the Development guide at:

#
## This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
## It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
## it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
##
## A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
## Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
##
## For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#stages
#
#stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
#  - build
#  - test
#  - deploy
#
#
#
#rust-nightly-build-job: # This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.
#  stage: build
#  image: rustlang/rust:nightly
#  script:
#    - echo "Compiling the code..."
#    - cargo build --verbose
#    - - echo "Compile complete."
#  allow_failure: true
#
#
#unit-tests-job:   # This job runs in the test stage.
#  stage: test    # It only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.
#  script:
#    - echo "Running unit tests... This will take about 60 seconds."
#    - sleep 2
##    - cargo test
#    - echo "unit testing complete"
#
##lint-test-job:   # This job also runs in the test stage.
##  stage: test    # It can run at the same time as unit-test-job (in parallel).
##  script:
##    - echo "Linting code... This will take about 10 seconds."
##    - sleep 10
##    - echo "No lint issues found."
#
#deploy-job:      # This job runs in the deploy stage.
#  stage: deploy  # It only runs when *both* jobs in the test stage complete successfully.
#  script:
#    - echo "Deploying application..."
#    - echo "Application successfully deployed."

# Optional: Pick zero or more services to be used on all builds.
# Only needed when using a docker container to run your tests in.
# Check out: http://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_images.html#what-is-a-service
# services:
#   - mysql:latest
#   - redis:latest
#   - postgres:latest

# Optional: Install a C compiler, cmake and git into the container.
# You will often need this when you (or any of your dependencies) depends on C code.
# before_script:
#   - apt-get update -yqq
#   - apt-get install -yqq --no-install-recommends build-essential

# Use cargo to test the project
test:cargo:
  script:
    - rustc --version && cargo --version  # Print version info for debugging
#    - cargo test --workspace --verbose
