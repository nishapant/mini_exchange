# Mini Exchange 

We developed an orderbook-based mini-exchange using the programming language Rust. The program consists of four primary applications: a gateway, an order matching engine, a dropcopy, and a market data ticker plant, as well as client machines to interact with the exchange.

Traders connect directly to the gateway using TCP to send orders and receive order updates. Currently traders input orders using a basic command line interface. After the order is submitted, it is sent to the Gateway where we validate the information contained in the order. If it is valid, the trade is sent to the order matching engine using UDP multicast. The matching engine receives orders and determines if the incoming order matches with any resting orders on the book. If no trades can be executed, and the incoming order is a limit order, we rest the order on the orderbook. Otherwise we use the gateway to send information back to the client indicating that the trade was not executed. The tickerplant publishes public market data using UDP multicast whenever a trade is executed. The dropcopy aggregates all private market data related to a single company and sends it to the main trader/client from the company.

## Git Repo Layout

- On the main branch, src/ has all of our code
- Everything is run from src/main.rs
- In order to run our project you must have cargo, rust, and vagrant installed locally on your computer.

## Instructions to Run Project

- To generate, provision, and turn on the VMs, run vagrant up. Make sure that VirtualBox or another VM manager is installed. We have already installed all the packages that the VMs need to run.

- `cd mini-exchange`
- `vagrant up`


To enter the terminal of a single VM, we need to SSH into a single VM. Open a new terminal for each entity in the Vagrantfile and ssh into the respective entity. To run a specific entity, we can provide command line arguments after running our main file. Below is an example of SSH’ing into a single VM and running that entity.

`vagrant status      # lists the statuses of the VMs`

`vagrant ssh gateway`

`cargo run gateway`


Make sure that each entity is up and running BEFORE you start the gateway. For the client specifically, there will be STDIN prompts that the user will need to provide to generate the orders. If you do not want to do this manually, you can create a simple python script that periodically pipes data into the STDIN of the client entity.

## Components

### Gateway

The gateway is the middle-man between the clients and the rest of the exchange. Clients communicate with the gateway to send orders and receive updates on submitted orders. The clients and gateway communicate via the transfer control protocol (TCP).  TCP is a reliable protocol (meaning dropped packets are automatically retransmitted), packets are ordered, and is unicast (one to one only). TCP is ideal for this component of the exchange compared to UDP as we can not have packets being dropped and need to ensure the ordering of trades.

### Client
The client represents a single trader submitting orders to the exchange. They only interact with the gateway via TCP. Additionally all the clients have a UDP multicast listener to pick up packets from the ticker plant and dropcopy.

### Order Matching Engine

The order matching engine receives the orders that were sent from the client through the gateway. It then utilizes an orderbook to determine if the order matches with any current resting orders and then adds that order to the order book and sends the result to the esb, dropcopy, and tickerplant.  An orderbook is an electronic list of buy and sell orders for a specific security or financial instrument organized by price level. Orderbook’s help improve market transparency as they provide information on price, availability, depth of trade, and who initiates transactions. The order matching engine utilizes UDP multicast to send packets reflecting changes to the order book to other internal components of the exchange simultaneously.


### Ticker Plant

The market data ticker plant utilizes the information sent from the order matching engine and creates a market data book update message. The tickerplant data update message is sent using UDP multicast, to which multiple clients can connect to and ensure simultaneous receipt of market data to minimize providing unfair advantages to a few clients.  

### Dropcopy

The dropcopy aggregates order and trade data for a single trading entity across all of its clients. The data that the gateway sends to each client is replicated in a single stream to a single machine, often used as a kill switch system at the broker-dealer. For example, one broker-dealer that has 10 different trading desks, each with its own connection to the gateway, can have a single back-office system that receives data from the dropcopy, to provide a holistic view.

## Testing
We developed tests for our exchange in order to ensure its functionality. They were particularly useful in validating orderbook/matching engine functionality. We also implemented a basic ci/cd pipeline that is able to run our test suite and maintain functionality of the project as we progressed throughout the course of the semester.
